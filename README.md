# About The Project
I was watching spycraft on Netflix and I was impressed about encrypting system. So I decided to make one of them! I can't send to somewhere and also I don't need to send but this project did improve my knowledge about programming. So if you want to use first of all you need to look guide. And also if you find a bug or an error please leave an issue!

# Build
Building is easy just enter the directory and type: ` make `

## Missing Part
Encoding and Decoding as an integer is limited to 2,147,483,647. So if you typed higher or result will be higher then result will be incorrect.
